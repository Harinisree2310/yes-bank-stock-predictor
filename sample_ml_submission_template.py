# **Project Summary -**

In the era of data-driven decision making, accurate forecasting of stock prices has become both a challenge and a necessity. This project presents a machine learning-based solution to predict the closing price of Yes Bank stock, using a combination of structured numerical data (such as Open, High, Low prices) and unstructured textual data (Remarks/comments). By integrating multiple preprocessing steps, advanced feature engineering, and optimized machine learning models, we deliver a predictive tool that can support investors and analysts in making informed decisions.

The dataset consisted of historical stock data for Yes Bank, including features such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and a column titled “Remarks” which included sentiment or contextual commentary about the stock on a given date. Our first step was data cleaning and preprocessing. We handled missing values using forward-fill techniques and identified outliers in numerical columns, which were treated using statistical capping to avoid their undue influence on the model.

Since the "Remarks" column contained unstructured text, we applied TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert it into a numerical format. However, the vectorized TF-IDF data introduced high dimensionality. To handle this, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique, which allowed us to retain 95% of the variance while reducing the number of features. This helped to prevent overfitting and reduce training time without losing valuable textual context.

For modeling, we began with three machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. The models were trained using an 80/20 time-based train-test split to preserve the temporal nature of stock market data. Each model's performance was evaluated using key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV, which allowed for systematic and exhaustive exploration of the model's parameter space. Among the three, XGBoost demonstrated the best performance, with the lowest MSE and highest R² Score, making it our final model of choice.

To make the model accessible and usable in real-world scenarios, we built a Flask web application. This app allows users to input the stock's Open, High, and Low prices for a specific day, and returns the predicted Close price. The trained XGBoost model and the scaler used for standardizing the input were saved using Pickle, and integrated into the Flask backend. The interface is simple and intuitive, making it usable for both technical and non-technical users.

This project showcases the effective use of machine learning, NLP (natural language processing), and deployment tools to build a practical stock prediction system. From a business perspective, this tool can help retail investors, trading platforms, and financial analysts anticipate market trends and make better investment decisions. Although this model was built specifically for Yes Bank, the framework is generalizable and can be adapted to other stocks or financial instruments with similar data.

In conclusion, this project not only demonstrates a technically sound approach to stock price prediction but also emphasizes the importance of end-to-end ML pipelines — from data wrangling and modeling to deployment — in delivering real-world AI solutions.

# **Problem Statement**

Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to its highly volatile and non-linear nature, influenced by numerous financial, economic, and emotional factors. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the closing price of Yes Bank stock, using both structured (numerical stock data) and unstructured (text remarks) features. The objective is to extract meaningful patterns from historical data using techniques like TF-IDF and PCA, and build an accurate predictive model using algorithms such as XGBoost. The end goal is to provide a tool that enables investors or analysts to make more informed decisions, supported by a deployable web-based interface.

## ***5. Hypothesis Testing***

### Based on your chart experiments, define three hypothetical statements from the dataset. In the next three questions, perform hypothesis testing to obtain final conclusion about the statements through your code and statistical testing.

Hypothesis 1

**Statement:**  
The average "Close" price before 2018 is significantly higher than after 2018.

**Motivation:**
This test is motivated by visual patterns in the line chart, which show a sharp drop in stock price starting in 2018.

Hypothesis 2

**Statement:**
The volatility (High - Low) was greater in 2019-2020 than in 2015-2016.

**Motivation:**
This test is motivated by the box plot and OHLC line charts that show more erratic prices around 2019-2020.

Hypothesis 3

**Statement:**
There is a strong positive correlation between Close and High prices.

**Motivation:**
 This test is motivated by Pair plot and heatmap that suggest strong correlation.

### Hypothetical Statement - 1

#### 1. State Your research hypothesis as a null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis.

**Null Hypothesis :**  
There is no significant difference in average "Close" prices before and after 2018.

**Alternative Hypothesis :**

print("\n🧹 Final few rows after cleaning:\n", stock_data.tail())

"""#### What all missing value imputation techniques have you used and why did you use those techniques?

Linear Interpolation (already done in data wrangling)

Why Used:

1. Stock data changes gradually over time (especially daily prices).

2. Linear interpolation fills missing values based on a straight line between known data points.

3. Ideal for time-series data where patterns are assumed to follow a trend or flow.

4. Helps preserve the natural progression of stock prices without abrupt jumps.

Forward Fill (ffill)

Why Used:

1. After interpolation, some beginning or trailing values might still be missing.
ffill() copies the last valid observation forward.

2. This is a safe fallback for stock data because:

3. If a value is missing on a certain day, the last known value is often a reasonable estimate.

4. Prevents dropping rows unnecessarily.

5. Common in financial datasets to avoid introducing bias.


Manual Replacement of Anomalies with NaN

Why Used:

1. Before interpolation, it's important to identify and neutralize anomalies that can skew results.

Example: A Low price higher than the High price, or a High value over ₹400 (unrealistic for Yes Bank historically).

2. By setting these outliers to NaN:

Date-based decomposition

Why used:
The Date column was originally a categorical string (e.g., 'Mar-19').

Converting it to datetime and extracting features allows the model to:

Understand seasonal patterns (Month)

Capture trends over time (Year)

Detect weekly behavior (DayOfWeek)

These numeric features can be used directly in models — no need for label or one-hot encoding.

3. Stable Results

##### Have you seen any improvement? Note down the improvement with updates Evaluation metric Score Chart.

Yes.
MSE improved by ~51% from Model 1 -Model 3

R² improved by 0.15 from Ridge to XGBoost -Stronger fit to data

XGBoost captured complex, non-linear relationships in stock price data better than Ridge or Random Forest

### 1. Which Evaluation metrics did you consider for a positive business impact and why?

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual stock prices
**Business impact**:
Tells us how far off the predictions are → Smaller errors = better price forecasting
2. R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
Indicates how well the model explains the variation in the actual prices

*Business impact**:
Shows how confidently the model captures stock trends → Higher R² = better model trustworthiness

### 2. Which ML model did you choose from the above created models as your final prediction model and why?

ML Model 3 - XGBoost Regressor.
 Lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) — means better accuracy in predicting stock prices

 Highest R² Score — model captures 89% of the price behavior

 Handles non-linearity, outliers, and feature interactions well — which is essential in financial data

 Works well even with missing values and smaller datasets

 Tuned using GridSearchCV + TimeSeriesSplit for stable time-dependent learning

### 3. Explain the model which you have used and the feature importance using any model explainability tool?

Final Model: XGBoost Regressor
About the Model:
Type: Ensemble learning model (gradient boosting on decision trees)

Key Strengths:

Handles non-linearity, outliers, and feature interactions

Built-in regularization avoids overfitting

Optimized using GridSearchCV for hyperparameters like n_estimators, max_depth, and learning_rate.

GBoost is making certain predictions by measuring feature importance using SHAP values.

# **Conclusion**

In this project, we successfully built a machine learning pipeline to predict the Close price of Yes Bank stock using historical trading data and textual remarks.

Key steps and outcomes:

Preprocessed both numerical (Open, High, Low) and textual (Remarks) features

Converted remarks into TF-IDF vectors, then applied PCA to reduce dimensionality and prevent overfitting

Trained multiple models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV for optimal performance

Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score, with XGBoost showing the best results

Saved the best-performing model and scaler as .pkl files for future use

Built a Flask web app for real-time prediction and deployed the entire solution in a GitHub-ready format

### ***Hurrah! You have successfully completed your Machine Learning Capstone Project !!!***
